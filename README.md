This is a full-stack notes project where I found the opportunity to learn backend with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

## 📖 Overview

Full-Stack Notes App is a web application that enables users to create, manage, and organize their notes efficiently. The project is split into two main parts:

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, Vite, TailwindCSS (etc.)
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB Atlas
- Deployment: Render

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete notes
- Organized notes management
- Responsive design (frontend implementation specifics may vary)

## 🏗️ Directory Structure
